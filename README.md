I've successfully implemented a Packet Monitoring System in C that simulates communication between a Transmitter and Receiver to track:
🔍 Missing Packets
🔁 Duplicate Packets
🆗 Unique Packets

📁 Project Structure:

main.c

transmitter.c

receiver.c

packet_utils.h

delay.h (Windows Sleep API used)

💻 Developed in VS Code on Windows using GCC.

✅ No hardware used – software-only simulation with real-time processing behavior.
