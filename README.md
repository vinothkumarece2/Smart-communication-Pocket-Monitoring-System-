# Smart-communication-Pocket-Monitoring-System-
A  C project simulating a data packet transmission system between a Transmitter and Receiver, with the ability to detect and handle:  
✅ Missing packets 
✅ Duplicate packets 
✅ Unique packets 
This implementation demonstrates error detection and retransmission, similar to real-world industrial or network communication systems.
